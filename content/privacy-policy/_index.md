Hey, I’m Joseph, and this is my website, [https://josephpinder.com](/). I take your privacy seriously, and this page explains what data is collected when you visit and how it's used.

## Data Collection

This site uses **Google Analytics** and **Meta Pixel** to better understand how visitors use the site and where they come from. These tools may collect basic information such as:

- Pages visited  
- Time spent on the site  
- Device and browser type  
- Referring websites or ads  
- Anonymized IP addresses  

This helps me improve the site and tailor content to what visitors find most useful.

## Cookies and Tracking

Google Analytics and Meta Pixel may use cookies or similar technologies to track visitor activity. You can manage or disable cookies in your browser settings at any time.

## No Personal Info Collected Directly

I do not collect names, emails, or any other personal details unless you choose to contact me directly. No forms or signups are currently used on the site.

## Children’s Privacy

This site is not intended for children under 13, and I do not knowingly collect any personal information from them.

## Changes to This Policy

If my data practices change, I’ll update this page to reflect any new tools or collection methods.
