Hey, I’m Joseph, and this is my website, [https://josephpinder.com](/). One of my main priorities is respecting the privacy of my visitors. This Privacy Policy explains my approach to data collection and use.

## No Data Collection

I do not collect, track, or store any personal data from visitors at this time. My website does not use cookies, analytics tools, or any other tracking mechanisms.

## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Since I’m not collecting or processing any personal information, no GDPR compliance measures are applicable at this time. If this policy changes in the future, I’ll update this page to reflect any new data collection practices.

## Log Files

I do not log or store any visitor data. This means no information such as IP addresses, browser types, or referring pages is recorded when you visit my site.

## Children’s Information

I do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Since no data collection is performed, this policy serves as a safeguard. Should this change, I’ll ensure that protections for children’s privacy remain a priority.

## Online Privacy Policy Only

This Privacy Policy applies to your visit to [https://josephpinder.com](/). Since I’m not collecting any data, this policy outlines my minimal data usage practices.

## Consent

By using my website, you acknowledge that no data is collected, tracked, or stored during your visit.
