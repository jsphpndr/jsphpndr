Hey, I’m Joseph. I’m committed to making my website accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. My goal is to create a space that’s welcoming, easy to use, and enjoyable for all visitors, regardless of their abilities or the technology they use.

## My Accessibility Efforts

I’ve taken steps to ensure that my site follows the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA**—a widely recognized standard for web accessibility. Here are some of the things I’ve done to make this site more accessible:
- Made sure the site works with a keyboard, so you don’t need a mouse to navigate.
- Added alternative text to images, so they’re accessible to screen readers.
- Designed the site to adapt well on different devices and assistive technologies.

## How You Can Help

While I’ve done my best, I know there’s always room for improvement. If you find anything on my site that’s hard to use or not accessible, I’d love to hear from you. Your feedback will help me make this space better for everyone.

## Get in Touch

If you encounter any accessibility issues or have suggestions, please let me know. You can reach me here:
- Email: {{<email local="hello" domain="josephpinder.com">}}

I’ll do my best to address any issues and respond to your message within [insert your response timeframe, e.g., 3 business days].

## Always Improving

I’m committed to ongoing learning and improvement. As I continue to update my site, I’ll prioritize accessibility and work toward making everything as user-friendly as possible. Thanks for being here! This statement was last updated on {{<date>}}.
