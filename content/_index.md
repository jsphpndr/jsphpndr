I'm a web designer, developer, educator, and business owner based in Nassau, Bahamas. I'm passionate about creating websites that look great and perform even better.

I share what I've learned through writing about front-end development, teaching courses, speaking at events, and consulting with companies on web strategies and best practices.

This blog is my little corner of the web to share some things I've learned along the way and the occasional random thought.
