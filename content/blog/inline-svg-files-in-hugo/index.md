This site is [built with HUGO](https://gohugo.io/). 

Wait. 

That's not why you're here.

The thing is, I've been picking up a few things along the way while building and tweaking this thing. I've run into a few issues here and there, gotten some answers and thought they might be worth sharing. 

Which is great, because I have something to write about, you get some help and it's an easy reference for the both of us. It's a win-win!

That being said let's get back to the reason you're here: inlining SVGs in HUGO.

## As a Static File

If you're just looking to inject inline SVGs into your HTML, then you can place your SVG file in your project's `static/` directory.

```
ðŸ“‚ static/
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ icons/          # âœ… Store SVG files here
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ logo.svg

```

Then to include it in your template, you can use the `readFile` and `safeHTML` functions.

```html

  {{ readFile "static/icons/logo.svg" | safeHTML }}

```

This works, but it could be better. Suppose you wanted wanted to use the same file in multiple places, but for accessibility and/or other reasons, you might want to change the `<title>` or some other content?

Well, that's where our next approach comes in...

## As a Partial

HUGO allows us to utilize SVGs as partials. So, the next approach involves putting your SVG in the `layouts/partials/` directory.

```
ðŸ“‚ layouts/
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ partials/         # âœ… Store SVG files here
 â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ icons/  
 â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ logo.svg
```

With this, we can pass variables to SVG partial and use them dynamically in our file.

In your template:

```html

{{- partial "icons/logo.svg" "Joe" -}}

```

In your partial:

```html

<svg  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="50" 
  role="img" aria-label="{{ . }}">
  <title>{{ . }}</title>
  <rect width="200" height="50" fill="blue" />
</svg>

```

Or if you want to pass more variables, you can use a map:

```html

{{ partial "icons/logo.svg" (dict "name" "Joe" "color" "red") }}

```

And in the partial:

```html

  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="50" 
    role="img" aria-label="{{ .name }}">
    <title>{{ .name }}</title>
    <rect width="200" height="50" fill="{{ .color }}" />
  </svg>


```

## As a Resource

As of right now, I don't have a CMS for this site. But let's say, that you do, because why would anyone sane do this without a CMS? Right?

Well, we can create a shortcode for this. We'll have the same limitations as we did earlier with a static file in not being able to pass any variables to the file, but meh...

The first thing we'll have to do is create a shortcode in `layouts/shortcodes/`. For the sake of simplicity, let's say `svg.html`.

In your shortcode, you'd do something like this;

```html
  <!-- We'll first use printf to format a string value. -->
  {{ $resourcePath := printf "uploads/%s.svg" (.Get "name") }}
  <!-- Then try to load the SVG from the provided path. -->
  {{ with resources.Get $resourcePath }}
    {{ .Content | safeHTML }}
  {{ else }}
  <!-- And if it fails, return this. -->
    <span>Icon not found: {{ .Get "name" }}</span>
  {{ end }}

```

And call it in your markdown like you would any other shortcode.

```

{{</* svg name="logo" */>}}

  
```

There's a more dynamic option if you're up for doing a bit more work, but honestly, I think this solution will cover most use cases.

If you've made it to the end, I hope you found this helpful! 

Happy coding!
